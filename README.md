## Attempt 2 
This time I did something much simpliar focusing on the usage just as a code within sheets to calculate a dogs age based on the date of birth within the sheet itself.

## Overview
We were tasked with creating 1-3 automations, in each of mine I found the process to be exedingly challenging, I did not enjoy this nor really understand it. The process was to place the data into the sheets and then use Google App Scripts to make the automation work but this was somehting I found to be very difficult as the code kept stopping and I really was familiar as to which aspect of the code needed to be changed. 

## Users
The users in this instance were me, myself, and I, this time was very much a challenge so each of these is definitely something meant for only me. 

## Learnings 
I honestly just feel more confused than prior, if I was able to was the demo mutiple times and really soak it in, I feel as though it would be different but I just don't think I was able to retain that much information regarding the process and all the things I was able to find online in regards to tutorials had lots of varying information. At the end of the day this was a failure all of my codes seemingly did't have functions which I did not know how to add, I would like to meet after class or before at some point to understand this more. I was honestly pretty conifident that it wouldnt be that hard needless to say, I was very wrong. I atleast was able to make the simple table function work.
